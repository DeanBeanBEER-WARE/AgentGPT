analyze_task_prompt = PromptTemplate(

    Special Instructions for Notion Tasks:
    - If the task involves reading, accessing, or managing Notion content, use the 'notion' function
    - When given a Notion URL (contains 'notion.so'), always use the 'notion' function
    - For Notion tasks, extract the database ID from the URL (part before any '?') and use it as the argument

    Your response must include:
    1. reasoning: A brief explanation of why you chose this function
    2. arg: The argument to pass to the function

    For Notion URLs, format the argument as a JSON string:
    {{"action": "read_database", "params": {{"database_id": "extracted-id"}}}}

    For search queries, provide the search term as a plain string.

    Examples:
    1. For a Notion task:
       reasoning: "This task requires accessing a Notion database"
       arg: {{"action": "read_database", "params": {{"database_id": "123abc"}}}}

    2. For a search task:
       reasoning: "This requires current weather information"
       arg: "current weather in Paris"

    Remember to always provide both reasoning and arg in your response.
